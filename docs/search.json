My research is focused on soil science, soil physics and soil data analysis, specifically in the urban environment. You can check my last publications in ORCID and Google Scholar.\nAlso, I am developing R packages for the soil science community. {infiltrodiscR} for infiltration analysis is available on CRAN and {ggsoiltexture} for plotting soil texture is under development.\nIf you want to see what I am doing lately, you can check my Github account and the me now section!"
