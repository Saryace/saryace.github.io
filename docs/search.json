My research is focused on soil science, soil physics and soil data analysis, specifically in the urban environment. You can check my last publications in ORCID and Google Scholar. Also, I‚Äôm the Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Agriculture and Natural Resources IJANR. IJANR is an open-access and public-good basis journal welcoming novelty and high-quality papers üìù\nAlso, I am developing R packages for the soil science community. {infiltrodiscR} for infiltration analysis is available on CRAN and {ggsoiltexture} for plotting soil texture is under development.\nIf you want to see what I am doing lately, you can check my Github account and the me now section!"
