## 👩🏽‍💻 Research

My research is focused on laboratory and field studies related to soil science and environmental studies, specifically in soil physics. Now I am interested in to understand urban soil ecosystem services, as part of my participation at the Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, [CEDEUS](https://en.cedeus.cl/about-us/the-centre/). I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities in this topic. For example, I started to sample soil samples in parks in Santiago:

Work in progress!

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-70.6412692, lat=-33.4356565, popup="Parque Forestal") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6401543, lat=-33.4404796, popup="Parque San Borja") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6320152, lat=-33.4348176, popup="Parque Balmaceda") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6185047, lat=-33.4957693, popup="Campus San Joaquín")
```

## 👩🏽‍🏫 Teaching

I'm currently teaching: - Geology/soil science (100%) - Research methodologies (50%) - Data analysis and visualization (100%).

Together with my colleague [Felipe Lobos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kh5Py2YAAAAJ&hl=en) we teach R and Python. Take a look at some of the results of the research methodologies course.

## 📝 Publications 

I am writing academic articles related to urban soils and soil physics. I am super proud of my colleagues [Carlos Bonilla](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y2lgbzcAAAAJ&hl=en), [Cristina Contreras](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jmrO2f8AAAAJ), and [Carolina Giraldo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kogVEjsAAAAJ&hl=en), and together we have published cool new stuff about soil physics.

With [Moreen Willaredt](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0081-3170) and [Beverly Alvarez-Torres](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3YHfa_gAAAAJ&hl=en) I have been exploring more about urban soils and their role in the urban soil hydrology.

UPDATE: ggsoiltexture was published!

## 🎤 Conferences

This year, 2025, I attended many conferences. I started with SSSA Soil Physics Fukushima, Japan, where I learned about the role of soil in the 2011 disaster. Then I participated in SUITMA25 in Pisa, Italy, where I presented preliminary data on air temperature and heat exposure in urban soils. I won an award for the best presentation on the topic! In Chile, I attended the Chilean Society of Soil Sciences Conference, where I shared the development of R packages, and finally I went to the VIII Chilean Public Health Congress.

## 📦 R packages

I have developed two R packages:

-   [ggsoiltexture](https://github.com/Saryace/ggsoiltexture): Provides a simple ggplot function for the plotting of soil textural data
-   [InfiltrodiscR](https://github.com/biofisicasuelos/infiltrodiscR): Provides functions for the modeling of data derived from the Minidisk Infiltrometer device.

## 🎮 Hobbies

When I was a kid, I never got to play much SNES or PS1 because my brothers used the consoles. Now as an adult, I set out to play some games on my own. This year I finished Megaman X and Megaman X2, and I want to advance in the saga.

I am a fan of the game Stardew Valley. I really want to try major game update, but lately I had been busy :(
