## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Research

My research is focused on laboratory and field studies related to soil science and environmental studies, specifically in soil physics. Now I am interested in to understand urban soil ecosystem services, as part of my participation at the Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, [CEDEUS](https://en.cedeus.cl/about-us/the-centre/). I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities in this topic. For example, I started to sample soil samples in parks in Santiago:

Work in progress!

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-70.6412692, lat=-33.4356565, popup="Parque Forestal") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6401543, lat=-33.4404796, popup="Parque San Borja") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6320152, lat=-33.4348176, popup="Parque Balmaceda") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6185047, lat=-33.4957693, popup="Campus San Joaqu√≠n")
```

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüè´ Teaching

I'm currently teaching: - Geology/soil science (100%) - Research methodologies (50%) - Data analysis and visualization (100%)

Together with my colleague [Felipe Lobos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kh5Py2YAAAAJ&hl=en) we teach R and python. Take a look at some of the results of the research methodologies course.

## üìù Publications and Conferences

I am writing academic articles related to urban soils and soil physics. I am super proud of my colleagues [Cristina Contreras](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jmrO2f8AAAAJ) and [Carolina Giraldo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kogVEjsAAAAJ&hl=en), and together we have published cool new stuff.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
library(scholar)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)

# Google Scholar ID
id <- "WJqqnIQAAAAJ"

# Get and filter publications from last year
last_year <- as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")) - 1
pubs <- get_publications(id) |>
  filter(year >= last_year) |>
  arrange(desc(year))

# Add Google Scholar search link for each title
pubs$Link <- paste0(
  "<a href='https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=",
  URLencode(pubs$title, reserved = TRUE),
  "' target='_blank'>Google Scholar</a>"
)

# Prepare clean table
pubs_clean <- pubs |>
  transmute(
    Title = title,
    Authors = author,
    Journal = journal,
    Year = year,
    Link = Link
  )

# Render table (with HTML links)
datatable(
  pubs_clean,
  escape = FALSE,
  options = list(
    pageLength = 3,
    searching = TRUE,
    paging = TRUE
  ),
  rownames = FALSE
)
```

## üì¶ R packages

I have developed two R packages:

-   [ggsoiltexture](https://github.com/Saryace/ggsoiltexture): Provides a simple ggplot function for the plotting of soil textural data
-   [InfiltrodiscR](https://github.com/biofisicasuelos/infiltrodiscR): Provides functions for the modeling of data derived from the Minidisk Infiltrometer device.

## üéÆ Hobbies

When I was a kid, I never got to play much SNES or PS1 because my brothers used the consoles. Now as an adult, I set out to play some games on my own. This year I finished Megaman X and Megaman X2, and I want to advance in the saga.

I am a fan of the game Stardew Valley, in November there is a major game update, so that will keep me entertained for many months.
