## Research

My research is focused on laboratory and field studies related to soil science and environmental studies, specifically in soil physics. Now I am interested in to understand urban soil ecosystem services, as part of my participation at the Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, [CEDEUS](https://en.cedeus.cl/about-us/the-centre/). I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities in this topic. For example, I started to sample soil samples in parks in Santiago:

Work in progress!

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-70.6412692, lat=-33.4356565, popup="Parque Forestal") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6401543, lat=-33.4404796, popup="Parque San Borja") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6320152, lat=-33.4348176, popup="Parque Balmaceda") %>% 
    addMarkers(lng=-70.6185047, lat=-33.4957693, popup="Campus San Joaquín")
```

## Teaching

-   I am teaching two courses this year: Statistical methods for natural resources (R classes) and Environmental Biophysics
-   I am preparing new materials for the following courses: Geology and Soil Sciences and Soil Conservation

## Publications and R packages

I am writing academic articles related to urban soils and soil physics. I am super proud of my labmates Cristina Contreras and Carolina Giraldo, and together we have published two papers in Geoderma this year!

I have developed two R packages: [ggsoiltexture](https://github.com/Saryace/ggsoiltexture): Provides a simple ggplot function for the plotting of soil textural data and [InfiltrodiscR](https://github.com/biofisicasuelos/infiltrodiscR): Provides functions for the modeling of data derived from the Minidisk Infiltrometer device.

## Working on grant applications

I am preparing my application to a project for Initiation in Research (FONDECYT Iniciación ANID-Chile) Geared towards young researchers who have obtained their PhD in the previous ten years. The head researcher, along with the sponsoring institution, obtains funding for technical personnel and thesis student.

## Inclusion and accesibility

I am interested in being a researcher who welcomes all her students and colleagues in an inclusive way. I am part of the Inclusion Committee in my Faculty and part of RLadiesGlobal, where I am learning how to teach and create more inclusive communities.

## Hobbies

When I was a kid, I never got to play much SNES or PS1 because my brothers used the consoles. Now as an adult, I set out to play some games on my own. This year I finished Megaman X and Megaman X2, and I want to advance in the saga.

I am a fan of the game Stardew Valley, in November there is a major game update, so that will keep me entertained for many months.
