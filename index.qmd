Hi! I am an Assistant Professor at [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en) and researcher at the Centre for Sustainable Urban Development, [CEDEUS](https://en.cedeus.cl/about-us/the-centre/). My research is focused on soil science, soil physics and soil data analysis, specifically in the urban environment. You can check my last publications in [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3203-2106) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WJqqnIQAAAAJ&hl=es). 

Also, I am developing R packages for the soil science community. [{infiltrodiscR}](https://github.com/cran/infiltrodiscR) for infiltration analysis is available on CRAN and [{ggsoiltexture}](https://github.com/Saryace/ggsoiltexture) for plotting soil texture is under development.

If you want to see what I am doing lately, you can check my [Github account](https://github.com/Saryace) and the [me now](https://saryace.github.io/now) section!
